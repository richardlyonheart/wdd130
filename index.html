<p>Good morning, My name is Brenden Lyon as it shows on the page, I am not very good at computers yet but I would like to be, 
    I work full time so now I am down to taking two classes at a time, hopefully I will be able to find the time this semester to actually complete the class.
I enjoy outdoor activities and to hang out with my family. </p>
