<p>Good morning, My name is Brenden Lyon as it shows on the page, I am not very good at computers yet but I would like to be, 
    I work full time so now I am down to taking two classes at a time, hopefully I will be able to find the time this semester to actually complete the class.
I enjoy outdoor activities and to hang out with my family. I am experimenting with a new form of office that should be able to help me keep focused on the task at hand. I am kind
of excited to be able to do so.</p>
